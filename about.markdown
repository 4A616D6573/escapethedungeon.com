# The Idea

Hi, welcome to Escape the Dungeon. A blog created to provide quick and easy adventure rooms that can be used in a table top role playing game, such as [Dungeons and Dragons](https://dnd.wizards.com/). These rooms can be used individually or as part of a larger campaign.

Players will start in the first room on the first floor and will be free to explore the connected rooms. Rooms will include a least one focus point and may contain items or characters that can be collected or interacted with.

Rooms will be created through inspiration or generated randomly with the assistance of random tables.

These rooms are designed to be system agnostic, attempts will be made to suggest the relevant approach to the Game Master but ultimately it is up to you/them.

Each room will include:

- 1 drawn room map, including a short description.
- 1 or more focus points, either combat, encounter or a challenge.
- A Game Masters Reference containing a number of pieces of information.

Options can also be added with a 1d20 roll.

| Roll | Option |
|:--------| :--- |
| 1-2 | Daily room is drawn on another level (Floor Level + d10) that connects to the previous posts room. |
| 3-4 | Refine a previous room, roll a d number of rooms to determine which one gets focus, reroll if room has already been improved recently. |
| 5-20 | Business as usual. |

**Note:** More options will be added as dungeon is expanded.

# Question and Answer

**Q: How are rooms and focus points generated?**

A: Either by inspiration or with assistance from random tables (list here). If randomly generated the table and roll will be included in the post.

**Q: How are room maps made?**

A: Usually by drawing a draft on blue grid paper with a [STAEDTLER 2B](https://www.staedtler.com.au/en/products/pencils-accessories/pencils/minerva-130-60-pencil/) pencil, then refined with [STAEDTLER Pigment Liner 308 Fineliners](https://www.staedtler.com.au/en/products/ink-writing-instruments/fineliners/pigment-liner-308-fineliner/).

The drawing is then scanned with [Adobe Scan](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.adobe.scan.android&hl=en_AU) and refined in [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/).

Generally the colour levels are changed to remove the blue grid, mode is set to grayscale and the colour curve adjusted to punch up the blacks. Cleanup of remaining grid lines is done if needed, then relevant text and room identifiers are added. Finally the finished map is exported as a PNG.

**Q: How do you track your ideas and workflow?**

A: Currently all ideas and tasks are tracked on a [Trello Board](https://trello.com/).
