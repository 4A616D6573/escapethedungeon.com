# The Idea

A weekday (Monday, Wednesday Friday) challenge to create an adventure **Room** with at least 1 **Focus Point** that can be used in a table top role playing game, such as [Dungeons and Dragons](https://dnd.wizards.com/).

These rooms are designed to be system agnostic, attempts will be made to suggest the relevant approach to the Game Master but ultimately it is up to you/them.

Each room will include:

- 1 drawn room map, including a short description.
- 1 or more focus points, either combat, encounter or a challenge.
- A Game Masters Reference containing a number of pieces of information.

Options can also be added with a daily roll.

| Roll | Option |
|:--------| :--- |
| 1 | Daily room is drawn on another level (Floor Level + d10) that connects to the previous posts room. |
| 2 | Refine a previous room, roll a d number of rooms to determine which one gets focus, reroll if room has already been improved recently. |

# Question and Answer

**Q: How are rooms and focus points generated?**

A: Either by inspiration or with assistance from random tables (list here). If randomly generated the table and roll will be included in the post.

**Q: How are room maps made?**

A: Usually by drawing a draft on blue grid paper with a [STAEDTLER 2B](https://www.staedtler.com.au/en/products/pencils-accessories/pencils/minerva-130-60-pencil/) pencil, then refined with [STAEDTLER Pigment Liner 308 Fineliners](https://www.staedtler.com.au/en/products/ink-writing-instruments/fineliners/pigment-liner-308-fineliner/).

The result is then scanned in at 600 dpi and ETC!

**Q: How do you track your ideas and workflow?**

A: Currently all ideas and tasks are tracked on a [Trello Board](https://trello.com/).
