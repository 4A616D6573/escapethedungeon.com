The adventurers probably need some starting equipment, if they find this room they will gen an opportunity to get some.

Most of the items in the table were thought up by me, when I couldn't think of anything else I got some items by rolling some random trinkets on [Donjon](https://donjon.bin.sh/5e/random/#type=trinket).
