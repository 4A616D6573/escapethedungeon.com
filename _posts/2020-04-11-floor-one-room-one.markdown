# Boxed Text

You and a number of unfamiliar companions awake to the feeling of stale air passing through your nostrils. You look around to find yourself laying naked in a smashed open cylinder, a light blue liquid slowly oozing out onto the floor.

# Focus Points

**Glowing Orb (F1-R1-FP01)**

A palm sized orb, pulsing a dull white glow. A medium magic check will reveal the orb is operating a reduced capacity but its true function is still unknown.

**Glass Vials (F1-R1-FP02)**

Empty thin long glass vials, A very easy inspection check will reveal that these vials socket into a metal ring at the base of the cylinders in the room.

**Exits (F1-R1-FP03)**

Above each door is a sign that denotes a direction. "North", "East", "South", and "West" following a clockwise direction. All doors are unlocked.

# Items

**Glowing Orb (F1-R1-ITM01)**

Pulsing a dull white glow, when initially discovered the orb is currently low on charge.

A very hard magic check will reveal that the orb can be recharged by an attuned wielder by expending 10 magic slots. Once charged this orb can hold and emit a single spell within a 20 foot radius as a concentration spell, requiring the attuned wielder to make a spell save every hour the spell is active.

When recharged and active the orb glows bright white.

**Preserving Liquid (F1-R1-ITM02)**

When consumed it heals for one standard potion, additionally the consumer must make a medium constitution saving throw or fall asleep for 1d4 hours. The properties of this liquid can be identified with a hard magic check.

## Authors Notes

&nbsp;

I had to choose somewhere for the adventures to start, waking up in some kind of hibernation tank seemed like a good as place as any. Allows of a variable number of players and provides an initial intrigue.

I decided to include a powerful magic item right out of the gate but make it difficult to use initially, its probably broken as hell but I can come back and refine it if needed.

Also included some healing potions go give the party a leg up.
