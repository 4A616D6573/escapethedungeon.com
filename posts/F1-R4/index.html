<h1 id="focus-points">Focus Points</h1>
<p><strong>Beauty The Dragon (F1-R4-CHR01)</strong></p>
<p>A closer look at the hulking figure on the eastern side of the room will reveal it to be a stone statue of a dragon, speckled with gemstones. An easy inspection check will reveal a small gemstone has fallen loose from the statue and lays on the ground.</p>
<p>Adventurers with a medium or higher intelligence will hear the sounds of light snoring inside their mind if they are within 20 feet of the statue. An easy magic check will reveal this dragon is petrified.</p>
<p>The dragon can be brought back to its original form with a scroll/spell of reverse petrification. If this occurs the dragon will talk to the adventures and will only attack if verbally or physically provoked.</p>
<p>If an adventurer has stolen one or more of its gemstones it will know who and will try and convince other adventurers to help it, before attacking the thief.</p>
<p>If the encounter ends peacefully it will give the adventures the Owl Key and teleport out of the room.</p>
<p><strong>Fresco Paintings</strong></p>
<p>A large area of the frescos have been singed by fire some time ago. A medium inspection check will reveal the remaining visuals of the painting to be a tale of a powerful figure and his army venturing into a large entrance in a mountain side.</p>
<p><strong>Exits</strong></p>
<p>To the eastern and western sides of the room are thick wooden double doors, the eastern side is blocked by the dragon statue unless it has moved or killed. On the southern side of the room is an open passageway.</p>
<h1 id="items">Items</h1>
<p><strong>Dragon Gemstones (F1-R4-ITM01)</strong></p>
<p>Fine gemstones of vary colors and shapes speckle the statue, one of the gemstones has fallen loose and lays on the floor. A medium strength check with an appropriate dungoneering tool will be able to pry these stones loose.</p>
<p><em>Note:</em> The dragon will know who stole its gemstones if it is ever unpetrified.</p>
<p><strong>Owl Key (F1-R4-ITM02)</strong></p>
<p>A short bronze key with the symbol of an owl etched into the bow. Using this key on the <a href="/references/intrigues/">Keyhole Panel</a> in <a href="/posts/F1-R3/">The Keyhole Room (F1-R3)</a> will materialise Credius' Bird Cage into the centre of the room.</p>
<p><strong>Credius' Bird Cage (F1-R4-ITM03)</strong></p>
<p>A small golden bird cage with a velvet cushioned floor, a plaque at the bottom of the cage reads "A fancy place to rest." in fine cursive.</p>
<p>A high magic or lore check will reveal that any small animal that spends a long rest in this cage will return to it when the holder whispers the words on the plaque. If the animal is killed it will return to the cage but its corpse will remain. Upon return the animal must spend an additional long rest in the cage for the effect to take hold again.</p>

<p>Starting to mess around with different shaped rooms. These half circles were make with an old Celco Compass but I've ordered a <a href="https://www.officeworks.com.au/shop/officeworks/p/celco-c68-circle-stencil-template-ja0178881" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Celco C68 Circle Stencil Template</a> to draw smaller circles better.</p>
<p>Added the first character to the dungeon although there isn't really a way for a new party to interact with it. It is however very close to the Keyhole Panel so if they do end up finding the correct items it should be easy to swing past again.</p>
<p>I couldn't think of a good wizard name of the top of my head so got Credius from <a href="https://www.fantasynamegenerators.com/wizard-names.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fantasy Name Generator</a>, maybe they'll be featured more later. I also learned that the handle of a key is called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lock_and_key" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bow</a>.</p>
<p>Might take a look at the item naming convention to see if I can come up with something clearer.</p>
